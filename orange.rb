# Orange Tree Challenge

# Let's create an orange tree that grows and lives for a finite time.
# It will bear and drop fruit. And you'll be able to harvest it.

# Start off by creating an object class called OrangeTree that has
# a height method that returns it's height and one_year_passes method,
# when called, ages the tree by one year.

# Each year your tree grows, any amount you choose, and, after some time,
# your tree should die. Poor tree.

# Once you can demonstrate the behavior of creating a tree, letting it
# grow age, and die, then you should give it the ability to bear fruit.
# Your tree shouldn't bear any fruit until it's reached a couple years
# of maturity. If you're up to it, your tree should produce more oranges
# as it ages, and it tapers-off just before it dies--totally optional.

# Finally, you should be able to count and harvest oranges each year.
# Create a method called count_the_oranges that returns the number of
# oranges on the tree and create a method called pick_an_orange that
# harvests one orange. Make sure that any fruit that's not harvested
# at the end of the year drops it's fruit. Demonstrate this behavior
# of counting, harvesting and the dropping of oranges in your program.
